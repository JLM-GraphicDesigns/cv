        <p><em>Visual and Graphic Designer for <strong><a href="https://jlmgraphicdesigns.com/">JLM Graphic Designs</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>As a Visual and Graphic Designer, I offer 15+ years of experience within various industries in graphic, visual and industrial design, marketing material development, brand creation, and advertising campaign execution. Through my recent continuing online training, I am also confident to say that I’m technically proficient in HTML5, CSS and Visual Design Fundamentals as well. My portfolio will demonstrate these strengths in creating and implementing design strategies to capitalize on market trends for small businesses and start-up companies alike.<br />
          <br />Previous employers and business owners have been pleased with my creativity and consistent attention to detail throughout all phases of project design and implementation. Additionally, I’m comfortable with handling multiple tasks in a fast-paced environment. I would also like to mention my collaborative and interpersonal skills as well, because being a dependable and adaptable team player is vital in any partnership. In order to do so, effective communication is what nurtures those team skills. That’s why I strive for transparent communication both verbally and written when I work on any project. I look forward to working with you and your team to produce fresh, innovative designs that will increase your return on investment. Let’s get started!</p></br></td>
